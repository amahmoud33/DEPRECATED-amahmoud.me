        To keep this brief, my passion for software develpment grew from my childhood. I played many games and eventually got into game development.
        As a child I was either playing football (soccer) or I was on my
        computer. So as you can tell, I never become a professional footballer.
        Although, I would say that this developer thing is pretty sweet 😊.</p>
