        To keep this brief, my passion for software develpment grew from my childhood. Playing games in which I was
        able to develop mods and private servers for. As a child I was either playing football (soccer) or I was on my
        computer. So as you can tell, I never become a professional footballer ðŸ˜¢.
        Although, I would say that this developer thing is pretty sweet ðŸ˜Š.</p>
