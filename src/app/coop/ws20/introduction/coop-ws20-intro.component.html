        Welcome to my Winter/Summer 2020 co-op report as a Software Developer at <a href="http://unitron.com/">Unitron</a>. This
        report will navigate through my experience as a return co-op at Unitron and present the evolution of the new and exciting projects I was working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above I am a returning co-op, I originally joined Unitron in Summer 2018 and successfully completed an
        amazing 8-month term. To my pleasure, I was offered the opportunity to come back for Summer 2019. Unitronâ€™s mission to
        empower people through smart hearing solutions resonates with my personal interests and is genuinely exciting.

        I am returning co-op to Unitron after two amazing terms - an 8 month and a 4 month term. At Unitron our goal to empower people with
        hearing loss by providing them a no-compromise solution allowing them to live a fullfilling life. Unitron's mission has always resonated
        with me and has provided me a strong drive while working.

      <p>
        During my Winter/Summer 2020 term I was part of a lot of new experiences as I was no longer exlusively working with the web team.
        My goal with this report to show the evolution of how I transitioned from working with web technologies to our desktop software 
        and other new and innovative projects.
