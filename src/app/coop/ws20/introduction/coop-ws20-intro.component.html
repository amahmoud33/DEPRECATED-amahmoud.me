        Welcome to my Summer 2019 co-op report as a Web Software Developer at <a href="http://unitron.com/">Unitron</a>. This
        report will highlight my experience as a return co-op at Unitron and the exciting new technologies that I had the
        pleasure of working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above I am a returning co-op, I originally joined Unitron in Summer 2018 and successfully completed an
        amazing 8-month term. To my pleasure, I was offered the opportunity to come back for Summer 2019. Unitronâ€™s mission to
        empower people through smart hearing solutions resonates with my personal interests and is genuinely exciting.
      </p>
      <p>During my Summer 2019 co-op term I learned new technologies, strengthen relationships, and grew as an individual. I
        hope this report accurately reflects my enjoyable experience at Unitron as a software developer and highlights the
        nuances of being a return co-op.
