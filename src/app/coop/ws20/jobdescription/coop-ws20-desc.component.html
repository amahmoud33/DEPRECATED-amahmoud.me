      As a returning co-op I spent over 8 months working with Unitronâ€™s web stack. During my first co-op term with Unitron I
      was provided many resources such as online courses and pair programming. As I worked on various projects, I continued
      to progress and improve the many required skills of a developer. In addition, Unitron frequently provides workshops,
      online resources, and mentorship when required to ensure that employees are competent.

    <h4 style="text-align: left;">My Day-to-Day Experience</h4>
    <p>
      As mentioned in my previous co-op report, I quickly learned about the importance of trust. On my first day Ara
      Talaslian, VP of Research and Development at Unitron, stressed the value trust. He mentioned that in order to be
      successful in any field you must be reliable, timely, and productive. In turn, this builds trust with other team
      members and allows your role to expand. In my experience, as I continued to work and produce code reliably during my
      term, I was entrusted with riskier tasks which enabled my growth as a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During everyday work, I spent a substantial amount of time work closely with marketing team to ensure that
      requirements are met and to communicate any potential changes in the requirements. In addition, I spent a substantial
      amount of time work closely with the SQA team to ensure that software is easily testable and bug free. Moreover, as an
      agile team, we had stand-ups, web sprint meetings, and demo days where we showcased the latest development of the
      newest features.
