    <h4>Unitron's History</h4>
    <p>
      Unitron was founded in 1964 in Newfoundland, Canada by partners Fred Stork, Rolf Strothmann, and Rolf Dohmer.
      Unitron’s mission is to provide top of the line hearing aid technology to improve the lives of those who
      have hearing loss. Since the beginning, Unitron has been focused on products and features that benefit
      the users directly. Throughout the 1960s-1980s, Unitron became a leader in
      <a href="http://unitron.com/content/unitron/nz/en/consumer/hearing-aids/styles.html#slide-2">Behind the Ear (BTE)</a>
      hearing aids for people with severe to profound hearing loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      As hearing aids transitioned from analogue to digital, Unitron did not stop innovating. As the 1990s began,
      Unitron started provided user-friendly and intuitive fitting software. This fitting software allowed advanced
      adjustments to be done to the digital hearing aids.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 2000s, Unitron was acquired by Phonak AG which eventually was transitioned into <a href="https://www.sonova.com">Sonova</a>.
      Unitron
      continued growing and eventually introduced the
      <a href="http://unitron.com/content/unitron/au/en/professional/hearing-solutions/flex.html">FLEX™ ecosystem and
        FLEX:TRIAL™</a>
