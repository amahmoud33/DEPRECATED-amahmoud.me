        Welcome to my Summer/Fall 2018 co-op experience as a Web Software Developer at <a href="http://unitron.com/">Unitron</a>.
        In late December 2017, I
        began to search for co-op positions where I was interested in more than just the position. I admired Unitronâ€™s
        mission, but after a visit to their booth at the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/event/8th-annual-guelph-tech-showcase">University
          of Guelph Tech Showcase</a>,
        I was certain that I wanted to work there. I was told of a great environment, friendly coworkers, and a growing
        company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, I was given an offer, and I gladly accepted it. During my 8-month term I met amazing people,
        strengthened my technical skills, and worked in my first professional software development team. By reading
        this
        report, I hope I can accurately reflect my amazing experience at Unitron.
